    <p> I am currently enrolled with BYU-I persuing a Batchelor's of science in Software
    Engineering, with a minor in Computer Programming. 
    From a young age I have always enjoyed creating tools and services that other people 
    could/can appreciate and solving complex problems to achieve said creations. I respect 
    each discipline within Software Engineering, and would explore them all if I had the time, 
    but I have chosen to focus on Software Design, or the design tools (UML, DFD, Flowcharts...), 
    languages (Python, C#...) , and metrics (time complexity, maintainability...) of software. 
    I have enjoyed the challenge and achievement of each and every project (maybe not always in 
    the moment, but certainly every time I look back on them). 
    So far I have been able to develop general work experience and ethic in a variety
    of places ranging from estate yards, to kitchens, to offices. I have developed
    skills to meet customer needs and manage stressful situations in call centers
    I have also learned diciplines of cooking, and landscaping that have helped me
    learn to work hard and with a persistent nature.</p> <br>
